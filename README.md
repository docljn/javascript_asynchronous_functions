# Asynchronous Functions in Javascript

Just a summary of my research while trying to understand the tricky bits of JavaScript Asynchronous functions.

Very much a work in progress.

1. [Synchronous code vs. Callbacks vs. Promises](./promises_vs_callbacks.md)

2. [Creating Promises](./creating_promises.md)

3. [Promisifying AJAX](promisifying_ajax.md)

4. [ES7 Async / Await syntax](es7_asyn_await.md)
